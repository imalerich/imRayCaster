# raycaster-cuda

## Overview

Implements a [raycaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) in CUDA. Rendered in real time to an OpenGL texture buffer. Currently only tested to work on Linux based systems, but could easily be ported to others by creating modifying the makefile.

## Dependencies

- [cuda](www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html)
- [glfw](https://glfw.rg)
- [glew](glew.sourceforge.net)
